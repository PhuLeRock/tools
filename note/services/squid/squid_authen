Squid also has support for proxy authentication. This is a simple idea that reads in a username and password, runs the specified authentication program, and either returns OK, if the username / password combination is correct, or ERR if it is not, in an endless loop. This can be used in many ways - simple system password lookups, database lookups or even a LDAP query.

By default, Squid comes with traditional proxy authentication in the SQUID_SRC_ROOT/auth_modules/NCSA directory. To compile it, cd into this directory and type:

	$ make
	# make install

Then add a line similar to the following to actually enable it:

	authenticate_program /usr/bin/ncsa_auth /usr/etc/passwd

Then add an ACL line similar to the following:

	acl authacl proxy_auth username .. # Use REQUIRED as a username for any

This can then be used in a http_access line, as follows:

	http_access allow authacl

Any requests to the proxy then have to be authenticated. You can also specify the text string which is given to the user when they are asked for a username / password by:

	proxy_auth_realm Squid proxy-caching web server

One issue with proxy authentication is, by default, it doesn't force authentication of FTP connections. This can be fixed by modifying the previous example to:

	acl ftp proto FTP
	...
	http_access deny FTP
	http_access allow authacl

Another issue is that you can't use proxy authentication with transparent proxing. A better approach would be to set up a auto proxy.
