To restrict access to the Squid proxy via the time, use the format:

       acl aclname time     [day-abbrevs]  [h1:m1-h2:m2]
           day-abbrevs:
               S - Sunday
               M - Monday
               T - Tuesday
               W - Wednesday
               H - Thursday
               F - Friday
               A - Saturday

This can be used, for instance, to restrict access to work hours (9am - 5pm, Monday to Friday).

	acl workdays time M T W H F 9:00-17:00
	http_access allow workdays
