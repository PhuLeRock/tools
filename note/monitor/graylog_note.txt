short describe: loggin app base on Elastisearch, but much easier to use.
Flow: 
- create input bind_address:port, number of worker -> no. worker is number of threads will handle network connections in this input.
- EXTRACTOR (is parser) is optional, when log come to graylog server through INPUT, EXTRACTOR filter log before push it into stream. 10:18
- create stream (rules) -> in this part, stream is parsing rules, you will choose the input, set the rule ex: hostname: DBserver will write to index named DB, hostname: web01 .. web09 will write to index named webserver.
- index: that means storage of your logs, you can set the size limit by GB of indices or arhive them in period.
create input: go to system/input -> edit input you will see the port, tcp/udp proctocol, then just setup that configure to client.
