or bash
and then uses gzip to make some CPU intensive job. Such a function is mono thread, so it generates 100% load on a single core. To generate 100% load on a multicore architecture, the script has to create multiple instances of the CPU consuming function. The script accept has input parameter the number of CPU consuming functions it has to launch..

#!/bin/bash
cpuConsumingFunc()
{
         dd if=/dev/urandom | bzip2 -9 >> /dev/null;
}
fulload()
{
    x=0
    while [ $x -lt $1 ]; do
        cpuConsumingFunc&
        let x=x+1 
    done
};
echo "----- Starting CPU load" 
fulload $1;
echo "Press enter to stop CPU load"
read;
echo "----- CPU load stopped"
killall dd
