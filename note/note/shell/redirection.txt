# all about redirection stdout stderr
1 = stdout
2 = stderr
>>file.txt: Open file.txt in append mode and redirect stdout there.
2>&1: Redirect stderr to "where stdout is currently going". In this case, that is a file opened in append mode. In other words, the &1 reuses the file descriptor which stdout currently uses.

## stderr
This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be written to a file.
grep da * 2> grep-errors.txt

This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be written to the same filedescriptor than stdout. 
grep da * 1>&2
Here, the stdout portion of the command is sent to stderr, you may notice that in differen ways.
