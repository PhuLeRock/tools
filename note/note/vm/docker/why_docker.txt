The traditional deployment model someone use VAGRANT, someone use linux native, VMWare use by another one.
Its hard to unified the platform software's version and configuration through all the machines.

Even if everyone use VAGRANT, it take much time to import, export the .ova box to another machines.
And if local test environment use on-premise, the deployment step take much more effort than deploy Docker images.

Docker take less effort than the other Virtualization solution when your dev_env is complex.
