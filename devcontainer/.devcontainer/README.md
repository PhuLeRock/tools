### How it works
VSCode plugin "dev container" will automatically read .devcontainer/*/devcontainer.json -> run Docker-compose.yaml. 
### How to use
In VSCode, install plugin dev container.
Open folder, command palette: dev containers: reopen container.

To stop, need to use MacOs terminal to run ```docker-compose down```
